            I have a Copilot extension installed in VSCode, and above the autocomplete 
            it recommended. Unlike that fellow from the Bucharest, I am a 
            postgraduate student at the UNSW studying Health Data Science.

            The inspiration for styling comes from <a href='https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/'
            target="_blank"> Monospace appreciation page</a>. As I have read in the inspiring book 
            <a href = "https://austinkleon.com/steal/" target="_blank">"Steal like an artist"</a> by Austin Kleon, you can learn a lot by copying. 
            Or as Dali said: "Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing."

            I am a Russian, so I want to show several thing that I want to be associated

            are <a href="https://ifarm.fi/blog/can-vertical-farming-be-profitable"

          <p>Last summer, a brilliant Alien franchise movie was released. In terms of spirit, it falls somewhere between the first and 
            second movies. It is a horror movie with elements of action. If you think it didn't bring anything new to the series, 
            just watch the scene where the main character is trapped in front of a closed door.

          <h3>Why is xenomorph from Alien so scary?</h3>
          <p>The design of the Xenomorph doesn't have eyes for one simple reasonâ€”humans freak out when they cannot see the eyes of another creature. 
            They cannot tell whether it is looking at them or not.</p>
