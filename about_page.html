            "I am a student of the Faculty of Computer Science and Cybernetics at
            the University of Bucharest. I am in the first year of study
            and I am passionate about programming and technology."

          I have a Copilot extension installed in VSCode, and above the autocomplete
          it recommended. Unlike that fellow from the Bucharest, I am a
          postgraduate student at UNSW studying Health Data Science. My background is clinical medicine and I worked as GP for 5 years.
          Now I am in a final year of program working on a thesis related to LLMs and RAGs.

          The inspiration for stylling comes from <a href='https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/'
            target="_blank"> the Monospace appreciation page</a>. As I have read in the inspiring book
          <a href="https://austinkleon.com/steal/" target="_blank">"Steal like an artist"</a> by Austin Kleon, you can
          learn a lot by copying. Or as Dali said: "Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing." 
          You can call it serendipidy but I started to learn HTML/CSS before finding out about the DevSoc's information. 
          I also have my very first HTML code saved and you can look at it <a href='/CapPhotoApp.html'>here</a>(I basically followed instructions from a 1-hour freecodecamp video).

          I am Russian, so I want to show several things that I want to be associated
          with my country rather than the current political situation. There
          are <a href="https://ifarm.fi/blog/can-vertical-farming-be-profitable" target="_blank">vertical farming</a>,
          <a href="HTML_01\img\russian_desman.jpg" target="_blank"> Russian desman</a> and brutalist architecture.
        </p>
        <p> Contrary to popular opinion that Internet has everything, I really struggled 
            to find a good picture of brutalist buildings in Russia. But instead I discovered a relic of the Soviet past, a book 
            about construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikal%E2%80%93Amur_Mainline" target="_blank">
            Baikal-Amur Mainline</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="img\bam_poster.jpg" alt="Baikal-Amur Mainline" width="300" height="500">
        <p>You can read about bitter-sweat taste of Soviet project <a href='https://www.gothiccountry.se/blog/354-bam-shattered-dreams.html' target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <img src="img\bam_stella.jpg" alt="Stella with truck" width="600" height="500">
        <p> Funny thing - all my life in Russia I saw different vehicles on such memorial but never payed much attention. From that book I discovered that 
            builders and workers just tried to copy behaviour of military that displayed tanks in a such way to honour the Soviet Army. </p>

        <p>Part of BAM called Devil's Bridge. I don't know why it is called like that. I would rather call like the bridge from the 
            <a href="https://youtu.be/vVFx8GcxNqw?si=hwGyaknVVkLMVm4O" target="_blank">video</a>. If you are interested, you can check the photos

        <p>There are over 9000 (literally) <a href='https://borisgi.ru/lenin_2020/' target='_blank'> streets named after Lenin</a> in Russia</p>
